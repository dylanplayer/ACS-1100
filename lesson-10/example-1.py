Let's practice creating a dictionary!

Dicitonaries are a collection of key:value pairs.


dict_name = {key:value, key:value, key:value}

# You own an empanada shop and want to store the price 
# of each type (flavor) of empanada. 

# TODO: Convert the two lists below into a dictionary 
# called menu, where the key is the flavor and the value 
# is the price (as an float)

menu = {
    "chicken" : 1.99,
    "beef" : 1.99,
    "cheese" : 1.00,
    "guava" : 2.50,
}
